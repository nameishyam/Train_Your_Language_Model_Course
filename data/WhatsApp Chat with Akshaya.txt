The psyco fellow
03/06/2025, 3:06 pm - Syam: Then age is the factor, for the tooth to get removed they have to come out of the bone 
At that time they are still under formation only inside the bone
03/06/2025, 3:06 pm - Akshaya: 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫 it's confusing

03/06/2025, 3:16 pm - Syam: For one side operation only, due to the pain I got fever also
03/06/2025, 3:16 pm - Akshaya: They will be giving anesthesia, right
03/06/2025, 3:16 pm - Syam: If both the sides they have performed the operation then I would be dead
